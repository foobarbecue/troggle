=== Overall ===

Is it too high tech? Is 500kb too big for a default front page? Does anyone mind if we get rid of the green {{{<h1>}}} style?

=== Main menu ===

Are the transparent links ok? Or is the clash with page text a problem?

The fade in images will be improved; eg the surveys one will appear under the surveys link when I get around to doing that.

=== Individual user preferences ===

We could store preferences in the user model so that for example, the mouseover images wouldn't load when people who don't like them log in.
